# minterceptor proposal

## Project description

* Develop a website with a recipe so that anyone, (in particulate school children), could use second-hand material to build mini interceptors which Asynchronously prevent rivers from polluting the ocean.
* Track the number of ones built and estimate the rubbish removed from the ocean.

#### Project inspiration:

1. The format for the idea is the **interceptor**, see [How it works.](https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/)
2. The variation suggestion is inspired by [**outdoor exercise equipment**](https://www.facebook.com/outfitireland/photos/pcb.2701096746660117/2701090889994036/) that may be found along footpaths
3. [concept 1](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1n5yAe2jI4KfqvJL4sW6MR5jMNSUt_CltsVRLXVaZScg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Project suggestion:

#### Help needed:

* what materials should be used
* proper schematics
* parts sources list

## Relevant Knowledge

Mechanical engineering  
Website development  
Marine life  
Environmental regulatory requirements

## Complexity and required time

### Complexity

* Intermediate - The user should have some prior knowledge of the technology to the point where they know how to use it, but not necessarily all the nooks and crannies of the technology

### Required time (ETA)

A couple of days
